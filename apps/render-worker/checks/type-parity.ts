// Proves the worker's domain types still match packages/shared-types.
//
// The worker cannot simply import them. Pulling a .ts file from another package
// into this program makes tsc emit JavaScript for it and moves the entry point:
// `dist/index.js`, which is what Railway starts, becomes
// `dist/apps/render-worker/index.js`. The alternative - a build step that emits
// declarations for shared-types - is a deploy change, not a type change.
//
// So the duplication stays and the drift is caught here instead. This file is
// outside the build's `include`, so it never reaches dist; it is compiled by
// `npm run check:types` (tsconfig.check.json, noEmit) and fails the build the
// day either side changes without the other.
